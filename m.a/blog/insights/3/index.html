        Foreign Investment Control in France – A Practical Guide for Investors; The World Financial Review
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        ***This article was originally written for and published by The World Financial Review by MAXIMUS & ASSOCIATES LEGAL CONSULT partner Olivia Lê Horovitz, the full text of the World Finance Review article, published with consent, is below.

      <h2>
        1. What is the control of foreign investments in France?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Foreign investment control is a system of prior authorization of certain investments strictly defined by law, implemented by the Ministry of the Economy. This mechanism has been in force in France since 1966. To carry out this control, the Ministry of the Economy, to which the Secretary of the General Directorate of the Treasury (“DGT“) reports, is responsible for examining certain investment transactions involving French entities to determine whether such transactions could be detrimental to public security, public order or the national defense interests of France.
      </p>

      <h2>
        2. Which foreign investments are subject to the control of the Ministry of Economy?
      </h2>

      <p>
        In France, the principle is that foreign investments are free. Only in exceptional cases are certain operations subject to prior authorization by the Ministry of the Economy. In 2021, 328 applications were examined by the DGT. Thus, the Ministry in charge of the economy will only proceed with an audit if three cumulative criteria are met:

      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The presence of a foreign investor;</li>
        <li>An investment operation as defined in article R 151-2 of the Monetary and Financial Code;</li>
        <li>Intervening in a sensitive sector.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The definition of a foreign investor is broad. It includes individuals of foreign nationality or tax residence, as well as entities incorporated under foreign law, but also entities incorporated under French law that are controlled by one or more of the above-mentioned persons or entities.
      </p>

      <p>
        The concept of an investment transaction varies according to the origin of the investor. Regardless of the nationality of the foreign investor, acquisitions of control or of all or part of a branch of activity of an entity governed by French law are subject to authorization. In addition, for investors from outside the European Union, prior authorization is also required to cross the threshold of 25% of the voting rights in a French-law entity. A temporary measure lowering the threshold for holding voting rights (10%) in listed French companies triggering foreign investment control¹ has been extended until December 31, 20232.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, and this is the most delicate criterion to handle, the operation must take place in a sensitive sector. These are activities set out by regulation, which fall within the sectors of defense and security, the press, energy or critical technologies.
      </p>

      <h2>
        3. Are intra-group transactions subject to foreign investment control?
      </h2>

      <p>
        When the investment is made between companies all belonging to the same group (i.e., held more than 50% of the capital or voting rights, directly or indirectly by the same shareholder), the authorization is deemed to have been granted.3
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, there is no need to file an application for authorization when the foreign Investor crosses the 25% threshold of an entity over which it has previously acquired control following the issuance of an authorization, or when the foreign investor acquires control of a company and has already received authorization in connection with the previous crossing of the 25% threshold of the capital or voting rights.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two exceptions to these exemptions: where the investment results in the violation of a condition that had been accepted by the investor in a previous authorization procedure, or where the purpose of the investment is to transfer abroad all or part of a branch of a sensitive activity.4
      </p>

      <h2>
        4. What are the “sensitive” sectors of activity, requiring investment control?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Sensitive sectors are sectors affecting national defense interests or likely to affect public order, public safety and activities essential to guaranteeing the country’s interests.
      </p>

      <p>
        A decree of the Council of State (“Conseil d’Etat”) sets the restrictive list of sectors and activities presenting such challenges. The list of these sectors was supplemented in 2014 to cover, in particular, critical infrastructure operation activities (“Montebourg” extension), by the decree of November 28, 2018, which came into force on January 1, 2019, to cover future technologies, aerospace, hosting of certain data, and by the decree of December 31, 2019, which came into force on April 1, 2020, which includes new sectors, in particular to take into account developments in the European regulation of March 19, 2019 establishing a framework for the screening of foreign direct investment in the Union, such as print media and online press services for political and general information, food safety, energy storage and critical technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        An order dated September 10, 2021 (the Order) has made a number of changes to the current regulations relating to the control of foreign investments, applicable since January 1, 2022. The Order extends the definition of critical technologies mentioned in 1° of III of Article R. 151-3 of the Monetary and Financial Code to include cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, robotics, additive manufacturing, semiconductors, quantum technologies, energy storage, biotechnologies and technologies involved in the production of renewable energy (solar, wind, hydraulic, biomass or geothermal energy), taking into account current developments and challenges in this sector. Henceforth, foreign investments in research and development activities involving such technologies will be subject to the prior control procedure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Article R. 151-3 of the Monetary and Financial Code identifies the sectors of activity in which foreign investments are subject to prior authorization. There are three types: activities that are sensitive in nature (R 151-3, I), activities involving infrastructure, goods or services that are essential to guarantee public security and public order (R 151-3, II), and research and development activities involving critical technologies and dual-use goods and technologies intended for implementation in one of the other activities mentioned above (R 151-3, III).
      </p>

      <p>
        Activities that are sensitive by nature are those that are likely to affect the interests of national defense, participate in the exercise of public authority, or are likely to affect public order and public safety. Without claiming to provide an exhaustive list, we can mention:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>activities related to weapons, ammunition, powders and explosive substances for military purposes;</li>
        <li>activities related to dual-use goods and technologies;</li>
        <li>cryptology or communication interception activities;</li>
        <li>or activities related to the illicit use of pathogens or toxic agents.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With regard to the second category of sensitive sectors: activities involving infrastructure, goods or services that are essential to guarantee public security and public order, the focus is on identifying these infrastructures, goods and services. These include infrastructure, goods or services that are essential to the continuity of water and energy supplies, to the operation of communication and transport networks and services (as well as space operations), to the protection of public health or food safety, or to the dissemination of information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, the last category, added in 2019, concerns research and development activities on dual-use goods (listed in Annex I of the Council Regulation (EC) of May 5, 2009), as well as critical technologies (cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, robotics, additive manufacturing, semiconductors, quantum technologies, energy storage and biotechnologies and technologies involved in the production of renewable energy).5
