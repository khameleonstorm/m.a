        U.S. Law Guide for U.S. Companies on ASX
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        MAXIMUS & ASSOCIATES LEGAL CONSULT Partner, Andrew Reilly, explores the reasons why many U.S. companies choose to undertake an initial public offering (IPO) and list on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Currently, over 20 U.S. incorporated companies and approximately 30 Australian incorporated companies with U.S. headquarters are listed on ASX.
      </p>

      <p>
        The purpose of this guide is to assist U.S. companies in understanding U.S. securities law implications when listing or already listed on ASX. While the majority of legal work for an IPO in Australia will be managed by Australian counsel, it’s vital for U.S. issuers to consider U.S. securities law considerations when choosing ASX as their primary listing. The guide provides a comprehensive overview of U.S. securities law considerations for both an Australian IPO and continued listing on ASX.

        Over the past 25 years, Andrew Reilly has represented Australian and New Zealand companies on more than 2,000 offers of debt and equity securities in the United States. He also advises underwriters and placement agents ranging from boutique to “bulge bracket” investment banks. Andrew’s practice focuses on US securities and corporate law matters. He advises on private placements, Rule 144A transactions and US public offers of debt and equity securities, including Nasdaq listings. He also advises on the re-domiciliation of Australian companies to Delaware and the listing of U.S. companies on ASX
