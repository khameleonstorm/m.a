        The Supreme Court Creates Increased Uncertainty by Expanding Doctrinal Scope of Personal Jurisdiction
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        On June 27, 2023, the Supreme Court decided in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 2023 WL 4187749 (2023) that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not prohibit the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a Pennsylvania state court based on a Pennsylvania statute mandating that an out-of-state entity be deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction as a condition to registering to do business in Pennsylvania.  The majority opinion was authored by Justice Gorsuch with Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, and Justice Sotomayor joining with respect to some or all of the decision; Justice Jackson and Justice Alito issued separate concurring opinions.  Justice Barret issued a dissent joined by Chief Justice Robert, Justice Kagan and Justice Kavanaugh.  This decision seems to expand the theoretical basis for out-of-state personal jurisdiction based on statute alone even for causes of action with no or little contact with the state so long as the statute can be deemed to have provided consent.  However, it is not clear that this would apply to any states other than Pennsylvania and Georgia without any new legislation.  Additionally, Justice Alito, in his concurrence, raised concerns about whether personal jurisdiction under this statute (or others like it) may be barred by the dormant Commerce Clause, an issue which likely will be considered on remand.  Thus, it may be that ultimately there is limited or little practical long-term impact from this decision with regard to existing statutes.

        Background
      </h2>

      <p>
        Mr. Mallory argued that there was no constitutional issue with the Pennsylvania State Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction.  Norfolk registered to do business in Pennsylvania in accordance with a Pennsylvania statute requiring out-of-state companies that register to do business in Pennsylvania to agree to appear in its courts on “any cause of action” against them. 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5301(a)(2)(i), (b)(2019)(the “Pennsylvania Registration Statute”).  Mr. Mallory argued that Norfolk had thus consented to personal jurisdiction in Pennsylvania by registering in the state in accordance with the Pennsylvania Registration Statute.  In addition, Norfolk has significant contacts with Pennsylvania as it manages thousands of miles of track, operates rail yards and runs locomotive repair shops in Pennsylvania.  Id.

        The trial court found Pennsylvania’s statutory scheme unconstitutional as it violated the Due Process Clause.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court acknowledged that its decision disagreed with a 2021 decision from the Georgia Supreme Court which had rejected a similar Due Process argument with regard to a Georgia statute.  Id. (citing Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v. McCall, 312 Ga. 422, 863 S.E.2d 81 (2021)).  The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve this split of authority and to determine “whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a State from requiring an out-of-state corporation to consent to personal jurisdiction to do business there”.  Mallory, 2023 WL 4187749 at *3.  The Court noted that it was not reviewing the question raised below (but not decided) of whether “Pennsylvania’s statutory scheme as applied here violates this Court’s dormant Commerce Clause doctrine”.  Id. at n.3.

        Decision

      <p>
        Justice Gorsuch writing for the majority/plurality explained that the “[t]he question before us [in this case] is not a new one.  In truth, it is a very old question — and one this Court resolved in Pennsylvania Fire Ins. Co. of Philadelphia v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co., 243 U.S. 93, 37 S.Ct. 344, 61 L.Ed. 610 (1917).  There, the Court unanimously held that laws like Pennsylvania’s comport with the Due Process Clause.”  Id. at *4.  Justice Gorsuch explained that historically an in personam (“transitory”) action could be brought against an individual wherever the defendant could be found and this historical “rule governing transitory actions still applies to natural persons today.  Some call it ‘tag’ jurisdiction”.  Id.; see also Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U.S. 604 (1990).  Justice Gorsuch explained that the courts have struggled applying the concept of tag jurisdiction to corporations which are “artificial persons created by law”.  In the 1800’s, many states “adopted statutes requiring out-of-state corporations to consent to in-state suits in exchange for the rights to exploit the local market and to receive the full range of benefits enjoyed by in-state corporations”.  Id. at *5.  The constitutionality of many of these statutes was challenged with one such challenge resulting in the 1917 Pennsylvania Fire decision.

        In Pennsylvania Fire, an Arizona company sued to collect on an insurance policy from an insurance company incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania under an insurance contract executed in Colorado for damage to a building.  “But it did not sue where the contract was formed (Colorado), or in its home State (Arizona), or even in the insurer’s home State (Pennsylvania).  Instead, Gold Issue Mining brought its claim in a Missouri state court.”  Id.  The insurance company objected that this was unconstitutional because the claim had “no connection to the State”.  Id.  The Missouri Supreme Court found that since there was a state statute requiring companies desiring to transact any business in the states to essentially agree to be served in the State, this statute did not violate the Due Process Clause.  The Supreme Court agreed with the Missouri Supreme Court.  Justice Holmes explained that there was no Due Process issue “because it [the insurance company] had agreed to accept service of process in Missouri on any suit as a condition of doing business there”.  Id. at *6  (citing Pennsylvania Fire, 243 U.S. at 95).  “[D]ue process allows a corporation to be sued on any claim in a State where it has appointed an agent to receive whatever suits may come”.  Mallory, 2023 WL 4187749 at *6.

        Justice Gorsuch explained that, in Mallory, as in Pennsylvania Fire, there is a statute requiring that in order to qualify as a foreign corporation, a company must agree to permit state courts to “exercise general personal jurisdiction” over the corporation.  Id. at *7.  Norfolk complied with this law, named a Commercial Registered Office Provider in Philadelphia county, and did business in Pennsylvania for over 20 years.  “All told, then, Norfolk Southern has agreed to be found in Pennsylvania and answer any suit there for more than 20 years.”  Id.  The Court explained that this process does not deny a defendant due process of law.

        Norfolk asked the Court to overrule Pennsylvania Fire; it argued that the Court had already largely done that in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945).  Justice Gorsuch disagreed and stated that the Court has not overruled Pennsylvania Fire and “‘[i]f a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case’ . . . a lower court ‘should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions”.  Id. (quoting Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989)).  Thus, “[t]he two precedents [International Shoe and Pennsylvania Fire] sit comfortably side by side.”  Mallory, 2023 WL 4187749 at *8.  In International Shoe, the Court held that “without agreeing to be present, the out-of-state corporation was still amenable to suit in Washington consistent with ‘fair play and substantial justice’ – terms the Court borrowed from Justice Holmes, the author of Pennsylvania Fire.”  Id. (citing International Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316).  Justice Gorsuch explained, “[i]n reality, then, all International Shoe did was stake out an additional road to jurisdiction over out-of-state corporations.  Pennsylvania Fire held that an out-of-state corporation that has consented to in-state suits in order to do business in the forum is susceptible to suit there.  International Shoe held that an out-of-state corporation that has not consented to in-state suits may also be susceptible to claims in the forum State . . . ”.  Mallory, 2023 WL 4187749 at *8 (emphasis in the original).  Moreover, cases subsequent to International Shoe recognized that “‘express or implied consent’ can continue to ground personal jurisdiction”.  Id. (citations omitted).
